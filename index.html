    <p><h1>OK ggole, where is DAAANM: DAAAAMN!!!!</h1></p>

    <p>
        O cursed feathered phantom, scourge of my mornings—
        thou DANM!! bird, herald of chaos perched upon my window’s edge!
        Why must thou torment me with thy shrill proclamations,
        those sharp, triumphant notes that spear the silence
        like a dagger through a weary heart?
    </p>
    <p>
        What grievance bears thee against my fragile peace?
        Hast thou sworn an oath to the sun itself
        to rouse me before its golden rays dare kiss the earth?
        Or art thou simply fashioned of mischief—
        a creature born of wind, wing, and wicked whim?
    </p>
    <p>
        Each dawn thou arrive, punctual as fate,
        and cry aloud as if to say,
        “Awake, mortal! For I command it so!”
        And yet—
        and yet…
    </p>
    <p>
        Beneath my exasperation stirs a reluctant awe.
        For in thy brazen call lives a force unbroken,
        a defiance that no sleepy soul can smother.
        Thou art small, yet unabashed;
        simple, yet sovereign of the rooftops.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps, dear tormentor,
        it is not hatred that lashes out within me
        but envy—
        envy of thy certainty, thy unshaken voice,
        thy unabashed existence in a world that oft mutes mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Still…
        if tomorrow’s dawn finds thee screeching at my sill,
        know this:
        I shall rise not in reverence, but in resignation—
        and whisper, through gritted teeth,
        “DANM!! bird… you win again.”
    </p>
